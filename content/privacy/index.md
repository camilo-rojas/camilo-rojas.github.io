This site is a simple static website. There are no forms, no logins, and no user accounts. I do not collect personal information.

What may be collected

- Basic analytics: I may use Google Analytics to understand overall traffic and popular pages. If enabled, it records anonymized usage data such as page views, browser type, approximate region, and referrers. I do not use it to track individuals.
- No advertising cookies: There is no ad tech, remarketing, or third‑party tracking pixels beyond optional analytics.

Your choices

- You can block analytics entirely using a content blocker or your browser’s privacy settings. The site works fine without analytics.

Data storage

- This site and its content are served statically. There is no server‑side database for visitors.

Contact

- If you have questions about this notice, reach me via the links on the About page.

That’s it.
